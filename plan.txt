Tests to write:
1. Arbitrary matrix multiplication (we supply p, q, r, and multiply a pxq and a
   qxr matrix).

2. ODE test of chain simulation using both serial and parallel matrix
   multiplication.  Take the length of the chain as a parameter.

3. ODE test of n unlinked bodies using serial and parallel stepping.  Take
   the number of bodies as a parameter.

Data to get:
1. For a chain with n bodies, the largest matrix multiplication that occurs each
   step is J*invM*J^T, where J is (n-1)*(6n), invM is (6n)*(6n), and J^T is
   (6n)*(n-1).  We want to use test (1) to find out where a matrix 
   multiplication of this form is faster in parallel than in serial.

2. Profile the serial simulation of the chain to find out how much time is spent
   in the step function.

3. Run test (2) for a set number of steps for a few different chain lengths.
   See if there is any length at which the parallel version is faster.

4. Run test (3) for a set number of steps for a few different numbers of bodies.
   See if there is any number at which the parallel version is faster.

Lower-priority:
1. make a video of one of our benchmarks
